       <h2 id="description">Pork Cutlet Soy Sauce Ramen</h2>
        <p>If you have ever wanted to make Japanese noodle house ramen, this tonkatsu recipe is for you. This everyday meal is
        great for singles with some cooking experience; it may take longer than the overall time without cooking experience. To
        save time, I rarely measure each ingredient's amount due to the large number of small measurements in the recipe.</p>

        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil 2</li>
            <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
            <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles (such as Shirakiku®), seasoning packet discarded</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
            <li>1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock (such as Hondashi®)</li>
            <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold
            water over egg and set aside to cool.</li>

            <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon
            sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients: 1 tablespoon
            olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.</li>

            <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking
            until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a
            colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.</li>

            <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat,
            until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>

            <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu
            sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
